# Trading_bot_BollingerBands
A MQL5 trading bot that uses the Bollinger Bands indicator to takes trades based on the volatility of a single currency.
You can use this Expert Advisor as an example and try to improve it to develop more advanced bot (ex with money management) with the powerful MQL5 language.
You can optimize the input parameters using the Genetic Algorithm of the MT5 platform (or write your own optimization algorithm with the language using GA, particle swarm, bayesian optimization, etc...).
But be really carefull of Overfitting : try to not optimize to much parameters and always perform an Out-Of-Sample optimization.
